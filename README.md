### Hello I'm Sam!

I build web apps for the financial industry and developer community. During the day I work at Codepotato, a web development agency - and by night I'm working on my personal projects.

#### Current Project :: Lasso!

Lasso is your asset "wrangler" (see what I did there). It's built for Laravel, and it automatically compiles your Webpack/Laravel Mix assets and uploads them to a Filesystem of your choice. It will then download those assets on all your web servers.

You can learn more about Lasso on the official website: [getlasso.dev](https://getlasso.dev)

### About Me
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... Country Music. My current favourite artists are Kip Moore, Luke Combs, Zac Brown Band, and Miranda Lambert

âš¡ Fun fact: I setup an internet radio station when I was 13 years old, which sparked my interest in Web Development!
