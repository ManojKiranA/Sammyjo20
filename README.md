### Hi there 👋 I'm Sam! Developer and wannabe cowboy  

I build web apps for the financial industry and developer community. During the day I work at Codepotato, a web development agency - and by night I'm working on my personal projects.

#### Current Project :: Lasso!

Lasso is your asset "wrangler" (see what I did there). It's built for Laravel, and it automatically compiles your Webpack/Laravel Mix assets and uploads them to a Filesystem of your choice. It will then download those assets on all your web servers.

❌ No more assets in Git

❌ No more slow servers while you wait for them to build assets

✅ Faster deployments!

You can learn more about Lasso on the official website: [getlasso.dev](https://getlasso.dev)

⚡ Fun fact: I setup a pirate internet radio station when I was 13 years old, it's what got me into Web Development!
